# Chessn't

This is a small project where I am programing a chess game using sfml lybraries for the gui.
Currently all pieces are implemented and I'm just adding the special moves like fork to the game.
After I'm done with implementing a functional board and pieces I'll focus to make it able to play with another pc in the same network.
